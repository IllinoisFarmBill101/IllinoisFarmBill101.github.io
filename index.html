                <p>The largest industry in Illinois is looking for the reauthorization of the Illinois farm
                    bill from congress. The bill from 2018 expried at the end of September 2023.
                    The reauthorization of this bill is considered one of the most important things the
                    U.S. Congress could do for the state of Illinois. Not only does it help put food on
                    our tables, but also it is a safety net for family farmers and ensures that we invest
                    in our research and development. Also, the bill provides funds and supplies to
                    rural communities that might need extra help. Therefore, if we do not get this
                    legislative deal done, we could potentially create uncertainty for these farmers
                    and communities.

                <p><i>Nikki Budzinski, U.S. Representative</i></p> 
                <br>
                <p>The U.S. representative that is really pushing for the reauthorization of this bill
                    was Nikki Budzinski. She shared her thoughts on the bill, why congress needs to
                    reauthorize it, and what all the bill covers. “This massive legislative package is an
                    opportunity for lawmakers to address farming and food needs while securing
                    critical funding for agricultural programs and research” Budzinski said of the
                    priorities regarding the bill. Her priorities are straight forward, she understands
                    how much this bill means to the next generation of family farmers and the
                    additional resources that come with it.</p>

        <h1>What does the Farm Bill cover?</h1>
        <div class="child2">
            <div class="secondArticle">
                <p id="topics">Nutrition and Commodity Programs</p>
                <p>These programs will help ensure that farmers who grow crops are supported and
                    that hunger in Illinois will be resolved. Farmers supported can grow more crops
                    and harvest them. This will relate to people who may not be able to access or buy
                    healthy food, so now with the help of the bill they will be able to do so now.</p>
                <p id="topics">Agricultural Development and Research</p>
                <p>These recent programs of the bill will improve smaller communities and will be
                    supportive towards smaller businesses. The agricultural research will be aimed
                    towards educating the next generation of farmers about the methods and
                    technologies of being a successful farmer that supports the people living in rural
                    areas. It will help them combat future problems and spread their knowledge to
                    other farmers.</p>
                <p id="topics">Crop Insurance</p>
                <p>Crop insurance is just like any other insurance. If the farmers' crops were to get
                    damaged from drought or extreme weather, they would get covered by their
                    insurance. Any losses against farmers will be guaranteed and the payment is
                    equal to the difference.Illinois is one of the biggest producers of soybeans, corn, and swine. The state’s
                    climate and varied soils allow for farmers to grow, raise, and harvest many diverse
                    types of agricultural commodities. Therefore, with the help of congress, we can
                    pass this bill and focus on the future of farming.
